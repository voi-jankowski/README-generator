## Description

I created this Weather Dashboard with travellers and tourists in mind, so they can check weather forecasts for any location around the world and plan their travels accordingly.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

When you open the page for the first time your browser will ask for your permission to check your location, after you accept that the page loads with the current weather and 5-days weather forecast for your present location.

![Opening of the page.](./assets/images/dashboard-1.png)

You can find the search box in Your Locations section, where you can type the name of your desired city and press search. You will be presented with up to 5 potential locations that can be found under that name. Click on the selected location on that list and the forecast for that place will be presented. Each search is saved in Your Locations and presented to you as clickable buttons for quich access if you wish to chack forecast for it again. Up to 6 locations can be stored, after that the oldest saved city will be removed to make room for your new location.

Your forecast is presented in **¬∞C** and **meters/sec** by default, but at the top of the page on the right hand side there is a cute little toggle to change the unit measurements for your forecasts if you prefer **¬∞F** and **miles/hour**. You can choose between **metric** represented by **_¬∞C_** and **imperial** represented by **_¬∞F_**. Try flicking it to live change your present search and your next search.

## License

## Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
